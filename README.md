# LoginRegisteration
 
First Screen has two EditText where the user has to admit his/her name and password. Neither of the two fields can be blank and the password has to be atleast 8 characters long.

Second Screen is a form which the user has to fill. All the fields are mandatory and the user has to accept the Terms & Conditions, otherwise the form won't be submitted. User's name from screen one is imported to screen two. If the user chooses "other" as their pronouns, an EditText becomes visible where the user can enter their specific pronouns, which is hidden otherwise.
